Moreover, fluents can have parameters: effectively describing multiple variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this example, `connected` will be a constant (i.e. it will never change in any execution), but another fluent `robot_at` will be used to model where the robot is: the robot is in locatiopn `l` if and only if `robot_at(l)` is true (we will ensure that exactly one such `l` exists, so that the robot is always in one single location)."

    "\n",
    "Now we have the problem variables, but in order to describe the possible evolutions of a systems we need to describe how these variables can be changed and how they can evolve. We model this problem using classical, action-based planning, where a set of actions is used to characterize the possible transitions of the system from a state to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "An action is a transition that can be applied if a specified set of preconditions is satisfied and that prescribes a set of effects that change the value of some fluents. All the fluents that are subjected to the action effects are unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "We allow _lifted_ actions, that are action with parameters: the parameters can be used to specify preconditions or effects and the planner will select among the possible values of each parameters the ones to be used to characterize a specific action. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we introduce an action called `move` that has two parameters of type `Location` indicating the current position of the robot `l_from` and the intended destination of the movement `l_to`. The `move(a, b)` action is applicable only when the robot is in position `a` (i.e. `robot_at(a)`) and if `a` and `b` are connected locations (i.e. `connected(a, b)`). As a result of applying the action `move(a, b)`, the robot is no longer in `a` and is instead in location `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the unified_planning, we can create actions by instantiating the `unified_planning.InstantaneousAction` class; parameters are specified as keyword arguments to the constructor as shown below. Preconditions and effects are added by means of the `add_precondition` and `add_effect` methods. "
