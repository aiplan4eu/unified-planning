    "All the compilers we used provide the capabilities of rewriting an action instance of the compiled problem into an action instance of the input problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, since we used a pipeline of 4 compilers, we have to rewrite back the plan 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To rewrite back a plan from the compiled problem to the input problem (respectively, compiled_plan and input_plan), we use 2 main features offered by the unified_planning_framework:\n",
    "- The `CompilationResult.map_back_action_instance`, a field of type: `Callable[[ActionInstance], ActionInstance]`. This function takes an `ActionInstance` of the compiled problem and returns the equivalent `ActionInstance` of the input problem.\n",
    "- The `Plan.replace_action_instances` method, which takes exactly 1 argument of type `Callable[[ActionInstance], ActionInstance]`, and creates a new plan where every action instance of the original plan is replaced with the result given by the function given as parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using those 2 features allows us to easily get the equivalent plan for the input problem, and by following the compilers pipeline backwards we can get the plan for the original problem."
