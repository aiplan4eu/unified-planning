    "## Define the planning engine\n",
    "A planning engine is a class inheriting from the `unified_planning.engines.Engine` class. The class shall inheriting also from at least one of the mixins class in `unified_planning.engines.mixins`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Custom options can be passed as keyword arguments in the constructor and each planning engine shall have a name specified by implementing the `name()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the UP library to filter applicable engines, the `supports` method must be implemented. The method shall return true if the engine is capable of dealing with the given `ProblemKind`, that is a class storing information on the problem class (much like the `:requiremnets` specification of PDDL).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a simple `OneshotPlanner` (see `unified_planning.engines.factory` for details and other operation modes). A `OneshotPlanner` is an instance of `unified_planning.engines.Engine` and `unified_planning.engines.mixins.OneshotPlannerMixin` that implements the `solve()` method returning a `up.engines.results.PlanGenerationResult` that contains plan in the form of an instance (or subclass) of `unified_planning.plan.Plan` if a plan could be found. In the code below, we implement a simple random walker that uses a `PlanValidator` (another operation mode) as a way to check if prefixes of plans are valid.\n"
