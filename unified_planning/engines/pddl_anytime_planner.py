# This module implements two different mechanisms to execute a PDDL planner in a
# subprocess, processing the output in real-time and imposing a timeout.
# The first one uses the "select" module to process the output and error streams
# while the subprocess is running. This method does not require multi-threading
# as it relies on the POSIX select to monitor multiple streams. Unfortunately,
# this method does not work in Windows because the select function only works
# with sockets. So, a second implementation uses asyncio futures to deal with
# the parallelism. This second method also has a limitation: it does not work in
# an environment that already uses asyncio (most notably in a google colab or in
# a python notebook).
#
# By default, on non-Windows OSs we use the first method and on Windows we
# always use the second. It is possible to use asyncio under unix by setting
# the environment variable UP_USE_ASYNCIO_PDDL_PLANNER to true.
