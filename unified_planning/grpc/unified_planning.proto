// =============== Types ================

// Type of expressions are represented as strings in protobuf format.
// A type might be, e.g., "int", "bool" or "location", where the latter is a problem-specific type.

// Built-in types:
//  - "bool"
//  - "int"
//  - "real"
//
// Any other string (e.g. "location") refers to a symbolic type and must have been declared in the problem definition.

// We can also consider restrictions to int/reals with specific syntax (e.g. "int[0,100]")
// but we need to agree on the semantics and syntax.
